# Yii2 news blog
Hi there!\
This is my first serious experience in programming.
While I was working on the project, I learn a lot of things such as Yii2, JS, CSS, HTML.\
In fact, I had no relevant experience before, and I only have a little knowledge about PHP.\
I still think that my project has errors or mistakes and if I find them, I fix them.\
I will be excited if my project helps someone with something.
