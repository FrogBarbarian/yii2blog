# Yii2 news blog
Hello!\
This is my first serious experience in programming.
While working on the project, I learned a lot of things, such as Yii2, JS, CSS, HTML.\
Actually, I had no relevant experience before, and I only had a little knowledge of PHP.\
I still think that my project has some errors or mistakes and if I find them, I'll fix them.\
I'll be excited if my project helps someone with something.
